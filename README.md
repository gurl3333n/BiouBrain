# BiouBrain
For the official BiouBrain website! BiouBrain includes me, Jolin Cheng and Danielle Choi and is currently under construction!

Bioubrain is a student-led initiative looking to help share Neuroscience related resources with secondary and elementary school students! 
Currently we are looking at establishing a website and social media, following which we will be looking at creating resources.

Thank you! Any questions, comments or feedback are greatly appreciated!
